# VBA-challenge
# Note to Graders:
- Two scripts, RunStepOne() and RunStepTwo(), were created for this exercise. First script inserts all required columns then performs first set of calculation for each unique ticker for each worksheet via loop functions. Second script validates that the first script has been run prior to loop through all worksheets and perform the second set of calculation for top tickers.
- A Controller sheet was added for sake of fun on code practicing and monitoring so I don't have to look at the spinning wheel only while waiting for 5 minutes or more for scripts to complete [see snippet "Controller.png"]. Additionally, it's where I note down the formulas needed to use in the first step calculations for yearly change, percent change, and total vol per ticker.
- Both scripts are executed via two buttons located on the Controller sheet.
